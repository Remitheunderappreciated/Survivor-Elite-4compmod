---Color Case update---

All vehicle props (including car alarms) now have logic programmed into their render colors; allowing them to be a random color everytime you play. 

Chapter edits:

Highway - end parking lot
streets - event area
plankcountry - town cleaning
hardrain - fog volume block bug
barge - "jungle gym" cleaning
the caves - 3 new leaves props added to the end of the chapter
ranchouse - new hittable
greenhouse - new plywood added to the roof in begginning (per request)

You should reacquire all map files from the stripper folder, almost all of them have been updated this month.
