Survivor Elite Overhaul for Compmod with Stripper

Programmed by Kay Goninan, known as Ɽǝϻɨ

(From what I hear I have put the information in wrong on the cfgogl configuration files. Someday in the near future I will fix the configuration settings so they will work with compmod. Not to mention i also need to update some of the balancing changes. However, the stripper files work perfectly fine and can be used independently from the compmod configuration files.) 

[Survivor Elite] is built around a mixture of realism mode and advanced difficulty versus. The maps are dramatically altered with many new additions and events. Teams will have to talk amongst one another in order to address their movement and priorities before exiting the saferoom. 

Resources are limited, so use them thoughtfully and strategically. Let your team know when you need ammo, because you may not be the only one who needs it. Team's will have to scavenge for new weapons and ammo depending on how well they planned and exicuted their offense.
