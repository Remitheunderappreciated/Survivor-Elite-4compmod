Survivor Elite Overhaul for Compmod with Stripper

Programmed by Kent Goninan, known as Ɽǝϻɨ

Survivor Elite is built around a mixture of realism mode and advanced difficulty versus. The maps are dramatically altered with many curveballs, new routes, and new events. Teams will have to talk amongst one another in order to address their movement and priorities before exiting the saferoom. 

Resources are limited, so use them thoughtfully and strategically. Let your team know when you need ammo, because you may not be the only one who needs ammo. Team's will have to scavenge for new weapons and ammo depending on how well they planned and exicuted their offensive.  

This mod is currently unfinished. However, it is in a playable state. 

Development time 1.5 years.
