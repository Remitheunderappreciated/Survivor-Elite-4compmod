Survivor Elite Overhaul for Compmod with Stripper

Programmed by Kent Goninan, known as Ɽǝϻɨ

Teams will have to talk amongst one another in order to address their movement and priorities before exiting the saferoom. Resources are limited, so use them thoughtfully and strategically. If you need ammo, let the team know, someone will know where a supply is and if not maybe they will take the time to scavenge with you. 

Survivor Elite is built around a mixture of realism mode and advanced difficulty versus.

This mod is currently unfinished. However, it is in a playable state. 

Development time 1.5 years.
