Survivor Elite Overhaul for Compmod

Programmed by Kent Goninan, known as Ɽǝϻɨ

As a long time player of the game Left 4 Dead 2, I've always seeked challenges in order to imporve my abilities.
After a few years of altering and testing different game configurations, I've concocted the perfect challenge for veteran players.
Survivor Elite aims to push the players into doing things they would have never considered before. 
To bring back that fresh sensation to an old game.
