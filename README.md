Survivor Elite Overhaul for Compmod

Programmed by Kent Goninan, known as Ɽǝϻɨ

This overhaul is a long time crafted blend of art and competitive practicality. Years of configuration mixing and level design is packaged within this repository. This is not meant to be zonemod, compete with zonemod, or replace zonemod. It's intended to be it's own competitive format that is based far from the vanille game. 

The goal is to make Left 4 Dead 2 fresh again for veteran players. This isn't about saying you are good because the game mode is hard. It's simply about being a gamemode for players who really like pushing themselves to the max. Knowing that it is no longer about how good you are as an individual but how well a team works together through the pressure of overwhelming odds. 

This mod is currently unfinished. However, it is in a playable state.
